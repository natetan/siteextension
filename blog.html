			You know, ever since I got into web development, I've been spending a bunch of time looking through the concepts of HTML and CSS and it's been seriously cool. The way all the links work together -- even through different files is simply mind blowing. I think I found a new hobby. This is a super basic website with some basic links. I'm really hoping that I get a really good page up and running by the time summer is over.
